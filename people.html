<p align="middle"><b>Dr. Michael R. Haberman, Principal Investigator</b></p>

Dr. Haberman is an Assistant Professor in the Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin with a joint appointment at the Applied Research Laboratories UT Austin. He received his Ph.D. and Master of Science degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2007 and 2001, respectively, and received a Diplôme de Doctorat in Engineering Mechanics from the Université de Lorraine in Metz, France in 2006. His undergraduate work in Mechanical Engineering was done at the University of Idaho, where he received a B.S. in 2000. Dr. Haberman's research interests are centered on elastic and acoustic wave propagation in complex media, acoustic metamaterials, new acoustic transduction materials, ultrasonic nondestructive testing, and vibro-acoustic transducers. He has worked extensively on the modeling and characterization of composite materials and the multi-objective design of acoustical materials. His current research focuses on modeling, design, and testing of composite materials, metamaterials, and structures. His research finds application in technical areas that include the absorption and isolation of acoustical, vibrational, and impulsive energy using negative stiffness, acoustic cloaking, and devices that make use of non-reciprocal acoustic and elastic wave phenomena. His work has been featured in Physics Today, Scientific American, NBC News, and National Public Radio.

<p align="middle"><b>Dr. Iyabo Iwal, postdoc</b></p>
Iyabo is an NSF/ASEE Post-Doctoral fellow with interests in using acoustics to provide better wear/fatigue diagnosis in tribology experiments. Iyabo completed her PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Rice University, where she studied how heuristic models such as the Bouc-Wen model, can be used to model contact using finite element methods (FEM). The FEM framework developed during her PhD work models non-linear effects of contact interfaces that include plasticity and friction. In her free time, she enjoys creating content for podcasts as well as playing music.

<p align="middle"><b>Samuel (Sam) Parker, PhD candidate</b></p>
Sam is a doctoral student at The University of Texas in Austin in the Haberman Research Group. He received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from North Carolina State University (2018) and a M.S. from UT Austin (2020). His M.S. research focused on the manipulation of sound via acoustic metasurfaces, with particular interests in acoustic holography and system design and optimization. He currently studies ultrasound in time-varying elastic media for applications in nondestructive evaluation. <i>Email:</i> <a href="mailto:sdparker@utexas.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sdparker@utexas.edu</a>
