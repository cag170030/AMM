# Haberman Group Website

The site is live at the following *obscure* link: [https://cag170030.github.io/amm/index.html](https://cag170030.github.io/amm/index.html) This will change when we establish a custom domain.

## What you need to know
1. [index.htmlhttps://github.com/cag170030/amm/blob/main/index.html]()  is the "Home" page. Line 71 is the description of the group.
1. [index.html]()  is the "Home" page. Line 71 is the description of the group.
2. research.html is the "Research" page. Lines 68-95 will contain info about the research topics.
3. people.html is the "People" page. Lines 66 on contain info about group members.
4. publications.html is the "Publications" page. 
5. research.html is encrypted and should not be edited on GitHub. I have an encryption code that I can run on my computer. So, whenever this page needs to be edited, it should be edited on a local drive, and then be re-encrypted and re-uploaded to GitHub.
 
## To do
1. Write out general group info on index.html
2. Finish populating publications.html
3. Add alumni to people.html
4. Populate research.html with topics
5. Ask Sam P. for resources to add to resources.html (longer term)

## To discuss
1. In people.html, should all the profile pics be the same square size? Or is it okay the way it is?
2. What do you think of the font across the site?
3. We can discuss domain names--I've found that Google Domains is very easy and cheap. Maybe we can choose a .org or .edu?
