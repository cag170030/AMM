# Haberman Group Website

The site is live at the following *obscure* link: [https://cag170030.github.io/amm/index.html](https://cag170030.github.io/amm/index.html) This will change when we establish a custom domain.

## What you need to know
1. [index.html](https://github.com/cag170030/amm/blob/main/index.html)  is the "Home" page. Line 71 is the description of the group.
2. [research.html](https://github.com/cag170030/amm/blob/main/research.html) is the "Research" page. Lines 68-95 will contain info about the research topics.
3. [people.html](https://github.com/cag170030/amm/blob/main/people.html)  is the "People" page. Line 66 & onwards contains info about group members.
4. [publications.html](https://github.com/cag170030/amm/blob/main/publications.html) is the "Publications" page. 
5. resources.html is encrypted and cannot be edited on GitHub. I have an encryption code that I can run on my computer. So, whenever this page needs to be edited, it should be edited on a local drive, and then be re-encrypted and re-uploaded to GitHub.
 
## To do
1. I've written out general group info/introductory information on index.html, but please look over it and edit accordingly.
2. ~~Add alumni to people.html~~ (Check the formatting--I chose bullets, not numbers, because it looks like a "class ranking" with numbers attached to people's names--but it's easy to change to numbers if you'd like that).
 2a. I should add the thesis/dissertation titles and co-advisors (if they have one) of all of the alumni. Ideally, we could also link to their thesis and dissertations on the (https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/11). That's pretty easy, but takes a little time.
3. Populate research.html with topics--I've added four topics which I believe reflects the work of the group, but I'm sure there's a better way to organize this.
4. Ask Sam P. for resources to add to resources.html (longer term)
5. ~~Add space between publications to make list more readable~~ (done)

## To discuss
1. ~~In people.html, should all the profile pics be the same square size? Or is it okay the way it is?~~ (It was looking shabby, so I went ahead and converted them all to square profile pics.)
2. What do you think of the font across the site?
 The font looks good. Keep it this way for now
3. We can discuss domain names--I've found that Google Domains is very easy and cheap. Maybe we can choose a .org or .edu?
