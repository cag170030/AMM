# Haberman Group Website

The site is live at the following *obscure* link: [https://chiragokani.github.io/amm/](https://chiragokani.github.io/amm/). This will change when we establish a custom domain.

## What you need to know
1. [index.html](https://chiragokani.github.io/amm/index.html)  is the "Home" page. Line 71 in the associated HTML file is the description of the group.
2. [research.html](https://chiragokani.github.io/amm/research.html) is the "Research" page. Lines 68-95 in the associated HTML will contain info about the research topics.
3. [people.html](https://chiragokani.github.io/amm/people.html)  is the "People" page. Line 66 & onwards contains info about group members.
4. [publications.html](https://chiragokani.github.io/amm/publications.html) is the "Publications" page. 
5. resources.html is encrypted and cannot be edited on GitHub. I have an encryption code that I can run on my computer. So, whenever this page needs to be edited, it should be edited on a local drive, and then be re-encrypted and re-uploaded to GitHub.
 
## To do
1. I've written out general group info/introductory information on index.html, but please look over it and edit accordingly.
2. ~~Add alumni to people.html~~ (Check the formatting--I chose bullets, not numbers, because it looks like a "class ranking" with numbers attached to people's names--but it's easy to change to numbers if you'd like that).
3. I should add the thesis/dissertation titles and co-advisors (if they have one) of all of the alumni. Ideally, we could also link to their thesis and dissertations on the (https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/11). That's pretty easy, but takes a little time.
4. We need bios/pictures of the following: Christina, Nate, Sam W., Ben G., Tyler M. Maybe I can knock this out at a group meeting/seminar where some of these folks are present. 
5. Populate research.html with topics--I've added four topics which I believe reflects the work of the group, but I'm sure there's a better way to organize this.
6. Ask Sam P. for resources to add to resources.html (longer term)

## To discuss
1. ~~In people.html, should all the profile pics be the same square size? Or is it okay the way it is? (It was looking shabby, so I went ahead and converted them all to square profile pics.)~~
2. ~~What do you think of the font across the site?~~
 The font looks good. Keep it this way for now
3. We can discuss domain names--I've found that Google Domains is very easy and cheap. Maybe we can choose a .org or .edu?
